Working on:
+ Practice creating and customizing forms
+ Using a CSS reset (Normalize.css)
+ My first responsive layout, with help from [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/#mobile-first-development) and a [Google Web Fundamentals tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns?hl=en)
