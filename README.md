In this project, I was practicing form validation and responsive design:
+ Creating and customizing forms
+ Client-side form validation, with help from [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw) and [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In0nB0ABaUk)
+ Using a CSS reset (Normalize.css)
+ My first responsive layout, with help from [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/#mobile-first-development) and a [Google Web Fundamentals tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns?hl=en)
